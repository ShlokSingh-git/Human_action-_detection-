Human Action Detection

A deep learning + computer vision project that detects and classifies **human actions** in video streams.  
It leverages **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and ML models to recognize real-time actions, making it useful for applications like **surveillance, healthcare monitoring, smart classrooms, and gesture-based interfaces**.


 Features
- Detects and classifies human actions in real time.  
- Uses **MediaPipe** for efficient pose & keypoint detection.  
- Built-in support for both **webcam live feed** and **video file input**.  
- Easy to extend with custom datasets or models.  
- Modular notebook format (`.ipynb`) for easy experimentation.  


 Requirements
Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
